# webgl-meetup-globe
The goal of this project is to visualize live meetup.com data on a webGL globe. The React app will consist of a split view, with cards animating into a list on a sidebar, and a live updated webGL globe. It will use rxJS streams to consume the API. Stretch goals will include allowing the user to filter the data using geofencing, keywords, etc.
